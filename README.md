## Disclaimer
I have been always passionate about tools. I always loved experimenting until I can find the right tool for the right task. Being a Front-End Developer requires to know the tools that exist and choose the one that will perform the task faster and better.

Based on hours of research and testing, I'm sharing all the applications I believe suits the best my work and daily workflow. It's a living MacOS configuration that, I hope, will also save you time for you to enjoy life more!

## Usage

- I tried to keep the right order you should also follow to install packages and applications on your Mac (particularly the [setup shell](#setup-shell) part)
- Some tools are free and some are not. I'm lucky to have the ability to pay for licences and subscriptions. But if you are not in that situation, 1) You will find free alternatives in the "Alternatives" section of most of the tools, 2) you don't need a paid tool to do an amazing work. Just choose the best tool that suits you and your situation.

### Where to find the right tool?
- [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/?ref=thedaviddias) - By far the best and well-know website where you can find almost everything you need. You will sometimes find a badge ![Upvote on Product Hunt][product-hunt] that redirects to the Product Hunt page. Show some ❤️ to the makers!
- [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/?ref=thedaviddias) - I regularly use AlternativeTo but find it limited and not always accurate. The "ups" are most of the time not relevant or doesn't reflect what people prefer the most. It's a great place to start if you are looking for a list of alternatives though.
- [Slant](https://www.slant.co/?ref=thedaviddias) and [stackshare](https://stackshare.io/?ref=thedaviddias) - Slant and Stackshare are kind of similar but Stackshare is more developer tools focused. It's a nice source of information to compare apps / web apps.

## Setup shell

#### [Xcode 11](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

- Xcode is required for some applications to run. So having Xcode updated just remove the issue of not being able to install some apps.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

#### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - The Missing Package Manager for macOS

```sh
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

With Homebrew comes `brew-cask` which will allow to install applications with the command line.

##### Useful commands for Homebrew

```sh
brew update                         # Fetch latest version of homebrew and formula.
brew search {app name}              # Searches all known Casks for a partial or exact match.
brew install {package name}         # Install a package
brew cask info {app name}           # Displays information about a given Cask
brew cask install {app name}        # Install the given cask.
brew cleanup
```

##### [Cakebrew](https://www.cakebrew.com/) (optional) - A GUI for Cask

```sh
brew cask install cakebrew
```

#### ZSH - An alternative shell to Bash

```sh
brew install zsh
```

Add this to my `./zshrc`

```sh
export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=/Applications"
```

#### [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install) - Framework for managing your Zsh configuration

Verify that ZSH is correctly installed

```sh
zsh --version
```

Additionally, Zsh should be set as the default shell.
Run `echo $SHELL` from a new terminal to confirm.
Expected result: `/usr/bin/zsh` or similar

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Check if Oh My Zsh was correctly installed.

⚠️ (never use brew to install nvm)

```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

And these lines to automatically switch your node version based on the `nvmrc` file.

```sh
# place this after nvm initialization!
autoload -U add-zsh-hook
load-nvmrc() {
  local node_version="$(nvm version)"
  local nvmrc_path="$(nvm_find_nvmrc)"

  if [ -n "$nvmrc_path" ]; then
    local nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version "$(cat "${nvmrc_path}")")

    if [ "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A" ]; then
      nvm install
    elif [ "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$node_version" ]; then
      nvm use
    fi
  elif [ "$node_version" != "$(nvm version default)" ]; then
    echo "Reverting to nvm default version"
    nvm use default
  fi
}
add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
load-nvmrc
```

To default a specific node version: `nvm alias default {version}`

#### [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) - Control incoming/outgoing network traffic
![Licence ~$30][licence-30] ![Usage high][usage-high] [![Upvote on Product Hunt][product-hunt]](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/little-snitch-4)

<details>
  <summary>What for? - What I ❤️ - What I 👎</summary>

##### What for?

* Little Snitch is perfect to block outgoing or incoming connections.
* When **I'm on the go** and using my mobile data, I usually block some heavy connections so I limit the amount of data spent.

##### What I ❤️

* Easy to use and clean UI

##### What I 👎

* I wish the confirmation window could save "my preferences", so I would not have to select "forever" every time.

</details>

##### CLI installation
```sh
brew cask install little-snitch
```

<img src="media/15878412922030.png" width="50" align="right">

#### [1Password](https://1password.com) - Password manager
![Yearly subscription][subscription-yearly] ![High usage][usage-high] ![Proprietary backup][backup-proprietary] [![Upvote on Product Hunt][product-hunt]](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/1password-7-for-mac-and-windows)

<details>
  <summary>What for? - What I ❤️ - What I 👎</summary>

##### What for?

* **Generate all of my passwords** with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password.
* No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website **[activating two factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/)** wherever possible.
* All my **applications licences** are saved in 1Password

##### What I ❤️

* 1Password is a native MacOS app and it's probably one of the reason I choose to move away from [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) in 2019.
* Fast
* I can save not just passwords but secure notes, bank accounts, licences...
* Have a shared vault with my wife and being able to send her by Airdrop a new entry.

##### What I 👎

* I loved that LastPass could recognize a form and automatically filled the inputs on a Website. 1Password requires you to 1) Click on the browser extension, 2) Click on "autofill"
* Not sure if it will be one day possible, but unlocking 1Password with the Apple Watch would be awesome.

</details>

##### Extensions / plugins
* [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x-%E2%80%93-password-ma/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa?hl=en) - Update settings and set the shortcut to `⌃⇧P`

<details>
  <summary>What for? - What I ❤️ - What I 👎</summary>

##### What for?

* **Open or switch quickly** to any application 
* **Text expansions**: previously using [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/), I switched in using the snippet feature in Alfred.

##### What I ❤️
    
* Unlimited possibilities to develop any workflows
* Integration with 1Password
* Price
* Tons of options

##### What I 👎

##### What for?

* An better alternative to the native calendar

##### What I ❤️

* Integration with Reminders and Meetup
* Lightweight
* Easy to use
* Lot of personalization options

##### What I 👎

* I usually understand and don't bother too much with subscriptions, but $52 a year is too much in comparison with other apps I used. Around $35 would make more sense to me. I'm using the free version and it's enough for my needs.
* It's clearly a "trap": when I access the premium details in the preferences, my only option is to click on "Start trial" or Force quit the app... I'm not fan of that.
